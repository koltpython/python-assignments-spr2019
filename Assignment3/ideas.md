# Potential Project Ideas

## Stuck?

_Here are some suggestions_

If you're totally stuck, it can help to think through your answers to the following questions.

What categories of stuff are you interested in? Machine learning? Sports? Food? Fashion? Music? Dev tools? Photography? Healthcare? Social media? Video games? Sleeping? Board games? Theater? Biophysics? Algorithms? Systems? Automation? AI? etc.

What data is available? Census data? Genome data? API data? Survey data? etc.

What problems do you care about? Healthcare? Food insecurity? Education? Climate change? Divestment? Mental health? Politics? etc.

You can do almost anything you would like to!

## Previous Proposals

_List of proposals from last quarter's final projects of Stanford's CS41. This list exists to show you the incredible breadth of projects that are possible!_

Bach - Programming a Python-based piano interface with various musical capabilities.

NoNonsense.py - scrape the genome of a new organism and return all the genes that will need to be changed, as well as all suggested primers to design to convert this to a viable system for nonsense suppression.

TeaWithStrangers - When given a group of people and their survey answers, the program will output clusters of people based on common interests with optimized probability of great conversations and new friendships.

RaspiTrack.py - Implementing a small number of computer vision algorithms in Python using a Raspberry Pi and a RPi Camera module, specifically focused on detecting circular objects, including edge-detection (Canny), k-means, and blob detection.

Tweet Analyzer - scrapes Tweets based on a hashtag and performs sentiment analysis

Hearts - Programming a Python-based interface for the game Hearts.

Kaggle.py - Participate in a Kaggle competition using Python

Juke - desktop jukebox application, allowing a user to create a playlist then people in proximity will be able to queue songs from their laptops onto the playlist

Fantasy Football Trade Generator - propose mutually beneficial trades between teams in any fantasy football league.
