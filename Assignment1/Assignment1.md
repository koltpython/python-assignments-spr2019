# Assignment 1: Connect Four
> Due: 5:30 PM, Monday, March 11

## Overview
This assignment aims to give you practice with a few of the Python fundamentals we've covered in class. Specifically, you will use your knowledge about console input/output, [control flow](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) (branching, loops, etc.) and [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists).

At a high level, in this assignment you will write code to simulate a [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game in your console.

- *Expected Time: 90 mins*
- *Max Time: 180 mins*

Note: Get started early! We want to resolve any confusions or submission problems earlier rather than later.

## Review

If you would like to, get a quick refresher by flipping through our slides from the past weeks on the [course website](https://koltpython.github.io/lecture). Also, we will conduct a review session on Wednesday 5:30 PM at class, you can find its slide after the review on the [course website](https://koltpython.github.io/assignments).

## Starter Code
Please get your starter code [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four.py).

![Connect Four Image](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IPEMVYCrMkY/VM6PFOc770I/AAAAAAAAALY/611ngVuBByI/s1600/Connect_Four.jpg)

You will implement a fully working Connect Four console game using Python. Please look into starter code and demo applications to see the functionality and some guidelines to implement the game. If you have not seen or played the game before, we suggest you to try it before working on assignment.

## Demo Run
We also uploaded a working connect_four application. For you can find it [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four) for macOS, and [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four.exe) for Windows10. Please experiment with it and use it as a reference when you are not sure how your program needs to handle a case. 

## Grading

Your grade for this assignment will be assessed on completion. If you successfully submit a Python program that largely follows the specification above, you will receive full credit on this assignment. We will not be very strict on edge cases, although we encourage you to attempt to match the above specification exactly.

We will be leaving feedback on your implementation and style, please check our feedbacks and ask questions about the parts you didn't understand.

## Submission

To submit your solution, login into [OK website](https://okpy.org) by using your Koc email address. The assignment submission page is under the course named **Python Certificate Program (Spring 2019)** which is already shared with you. All you have to do is to choose the assignment you solved and create a new submission. Drag and drop your code into the specified place, and submit it. You will only submit single file named ```connect_four.py``` for this assignment.
