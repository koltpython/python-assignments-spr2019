# Assignment 1: Connect Four
> Due: 5:30 PM, Monday, March 11

## Overview
This assignment aims to give you practice with a few of the Python fundamentals we've covered in class. Specifically, you will use your knowledge about console input/output, [control flow](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) (branching, loops, etc.) and [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists).

At a high level, in this assignment you will write code to simulate a [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game in your console.

- *Expected Time: 90 mins*
- *Max Time: 180 mins*

Note: Get started early! We want to resolve any confusions or submission problems earlier rather than later.

## Review

If you would like to, get a quick refresher by flipping through our slides from the past weeks on the [course website](https://koltpython.github.io/lecture). Also, we will conduct a review session on Wednesday 5:30 PM at class, you can find its slide after the review on the [course website](https://koltpython.github.io/assignments).

## Starter Code
Please get your starter code [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four.py).

> You can right click and save the file if download does not automatically start.

## Task

![Connect Four Image](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IPEMVYCrMkY/VM6PFOc770I/AAAAAAAAALY/611ngVuBByI/s1600/Connect_Four.jpg)

You will implement a fully working Connect Four console game using Python. Please look into starter code and demo applications to see the expected functionality and some guidelines to implement the game. If you have not seen or played the game before, we suggest you to try it before working on assignment. Please inform us if you encounter an error during this process by sending an email to [auysal16@ku.edu.tr](mailto:auysal16@ku.edu.tr).

## Demo Application
We also uploaded a working connect_four application. Please follow instructions below for your OS to downloading and running it. Experiment with it to understand the game and use it as a reference when you are not sure how your program needs to handle a case. 

### Windows
1. Download the executable file from [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four.exe).
2. Run the `.exe` file, if Windows Defender does not allow you to open it, click More info and select Run anyway.

### MacOS Option 1
1. You can download the executable file from [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four).
2. Open a terminal window, change your directory to folder that contains the executable you just downloaded.
3. Change mod of the file to executable by running `chmod +x connect_four` in your terminal.
4. Run the file with ` ./connect_four` command from your terminal.

### MacOS Option 2
1. You can download the archive from [here](https://github.com/koltpython/python-assignments/raw/master/Assignment1/connect_four.zip).
2. Extract the zip file and open it from Finder.
3. Locate the file named `connect_four` and run it by double clicking. 

## Grading

Your grade for this assignment will be assessed on completion. If you successfully submit a Python program that largely follows the specification above, you will receive full credit on this assignment. We will not be very strict on edge cases, although we encourage you to attempt to match the above specification exactly.

We will be leaving feedback on your implementation and style, please check our feedbacks and ask questions about the parts you didn't understand.

## Submission

To submit your solution, login into [OK website](https://okpy.org) by using your Koc email address. The assignment submission page is under the course named **Python Certificate Program (Spring 2019)** which is already shared with you. All you have to do is to choose the assignment you solved and create a new submission. Drag and drop your code into the specified place, and submit it. You will only submit single file named `connect_four.py` for this assignment.
