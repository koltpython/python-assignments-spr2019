# Assignment 0: Welcome to Python!

> Due: 5:30 PM, Mon Feb 25

## Overview

This introductory assignment aims to give you practice with a few of the Python fundamentals we've covered in class. More importantly, the goal of this warmup assignment is to ensure that your local Python installation is set up correctly and that you are familiar with the submission process.

At a high level, in this assignment you will write code to practice variables and console input/output.

- _Expected Time: 20 mins_
- _Max Time: 40 mins_

Note: Get started early! We want to resolve any installation or submission problems earlier rather than later.

## Review

If you would like to, get a quick refresher by flipping through our slides from the first week on the [course website](https://koltpython.github.io/lecture).

## Questions

### Question 1: Good old 'Hello, World!'

Write a program that displays `Hello, World!` in the console.

### Question 2: Favorite Number

Alex is a little girl who wants to play a guess game. She starts the game with asking the player's name and his/her favourite number. Since she can only count up to 5, the player should choose a number between 1 and 5 to play the game with Alex. Then she will try to guess the number.

#### Part 1: Get Favorite Number from User

Write a program that takes the player's name and his/her favourite number, and print this number on console as shown below.

##### Sample Run

```
What's your name? Heidi
Tell me a number from 1 to 5: 4
Your favorite number is 4, Heidi.
```

#### Part 2: Guess The Number

Then you should print five sentences as **"Hi \_** ! Your number is **\_ . False"** or **"Hi \_** ! Your number is **\_ . True"** depending on the truthness of the sentence.

##### Sample Output

```
Hi Heidi! Your number is 1. False
Hi Heidi! Your number is 2. False
Hi Heidi! Your number is 3. False
Hi Heidi! Your number is 4. True
Hi Heidi! Your number is 5. False
```

> Hint: == is an equality operator in Python. We use it to compare two variables or values and see if they are equal. It gives True or False, correspondingly.

### Question 3: mathematical operations

In this question, you are expected to get two integers from the user. Then print the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of these two integers as shown in the sample output.

##### Sample Input

```
First integer: 3
Second integer: 2
```

##### Sample Output

```
3 + 2 = 5
3 - 2 = 1
3 * 2 = 6
3 / 2 = 1.5
```

> Note: You are not responsible for the case second integer being 0. But check it out and see what happens when you divide by zero.

## Grading

Your grade for this assignment will be assessed on completion. If you successfully submit a Python program that largely follows the specification above, you will receive full credit on this assignment. We will not be very strict on edge cases, although we encourage you to attempt to match the above specification exactly.

We will not be grading your style on this assignment, since we haven't yet talked about what good Python style looks like in detail. However, we will be leaving feedback on your style, so take a pass through your completed assignment to make its style feel good (to you!) if you haven't already done that.

## Submission

**WAIT FOR WEDNESDAY TO SEE HOW YOU WILL SUBMIT, WE WILL HAVE A SUBMISSION DEMO ON CLASS**

To submit your solution, login into [course website](https://okpy.org) by using your Koc email address. The assignment submission page is under the course named **Python Certificate Program (Spring 2019)** which is already shared with you. All you have to do is to choose the assignment you solved and create a new submission. Drag and drop your code into the specified place, and submit it. If you have applied all these steps, congratulations, you sent your very first solution to us!
