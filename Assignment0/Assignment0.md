## Overview

This introductory assignment aims to give you practice with a few of the Python fundamentals we've covered in class. More importantly, the goal of this warmup assignment is to ensure that your local Python installation is set up correctly and that you are familiar with the submission process.

At a high level, in this assignment you will write code to ........................

- *Expected Time: 40 mins*
- *Max Time: 1 hour*

Note: Get started early! We want to resolve any installation or submission problems earlier rather than later.

## Review

If you would like to, get a quick refresher by flipping through our slides from the first week on the [course website](https://koltpython.github.io/lecture).

## Questions

In this question, you are expected to ask user's name and a number from 1 to 5. Then you should print five sentences as __"Hi ___ ! Your number is ___ . False"__ or __"Hi ___ ! Your number is ___ . True"__ depends on the truthness of the sentence. 

### Sample Input
```

Hi Alex! Your number is 1. False
Hi Alex! Your number is 2. False
Hi Alex! Your number is 3. False
Hi Alex! Your number is 4. True
